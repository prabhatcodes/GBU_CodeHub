# GBU_CodeHub
Website to make the students of GBU aware about competitive programming.
(Will update the full code tommorow i.e. 14th September 2017)
Programming is something which is very important to every engineer nowadays.
An easy way to become a professional coder and learning to think critically is by competetive programming.
As starting competetive programming can be a little overwhelming task for newbies, there are countless websites(Codechef, Hackerearth, topcoder to name a few), numerous languages etc.
Our seniors at the Programming club, GBU can use this website so that all the interested students contantly get their doubts resolved via this platform, they will get questions constantly to solve, which they can submit their codes online for review.
Students will be able to discuss their problems direclty on this forum.
It will also contain resourses to learn programming.
